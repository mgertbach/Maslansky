Molongui Authorship plugin is created by [Molongui](https://www.molongui.com/ "Molongui Authorship by Molongui").



== Highlights ==

= Multiple authors for posts =

Do you want to show multiple authors for a post in WordPress? Many websites often have more than one author working on the same article. In that case you may want to give credit to all the authors who worked on the post.

Add multiple authors for posts and pages, as many as you like. Just use the selector you will find on edit-post page to add, order and remove multiple authors.

Byline is updated accordingly everywhere on your site by default. You can choose how many author names to be displayed on it: all, just the main author, main author plus remaining number of authors, first two plus remaining number of authors...

The order how the authors are listed is important because the first one will be taken as the "main" author for the post. That's why you can easily re-order authors by drag-and-drop.

Advanced users and developers may use the Molongui Authorship template tags to list multi-authors anywhere they would normally list the author. Take a look at plugin's documentation to know how to.

= Guest authors =

You might have contributing authors who write for your blog but you don't want to give them access to your WordPress installation, not even with a subscriber role. Even if that's the case, it would be nice to give them credit for what they wrote anyway.

Add writers as bylines without creating WordPress user accounts. Simply create a guest author profile for the writer and assign him/her to the post or page of your choice. Just use the selector you will find on edit-post page to add the defined guest author.

As it happens with multiple authors, byline is updated everywhere on you site by default.

= Author box =

Give credit to the authors and contributors of your blog by showing their profile information in a fancy and minimalistic box on all posts, all pages or just on those that you configure.

Add as much information about the author as you need: name, picture, personal link, job title, company, company link, social media links, bio... even choose whether to show related posts from that author to increase page views and session duration.

Each author can have a different set of social media profiles added. Just choose from more than 70 social networks: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram, Vk, Flickr, Vine, Meetup, Sina-weibo, Deviantart, Stumbleupon, Myspace, Mixi, SoundCloud, Last.fm, Foursquare, Vimeo, Spotify, GitHub, CodePen...  Check out the complete list [here](https://www.molongui.com/kb/complete-list-of-social-network-profile-fields-available/ "Complete list of social network profile fields available").

You can even choose whether to show the author box above or below your content and customize colors, sizes, effects, shapes and other styles to make it look sexy.

All with different author box layouts with structured data to help search engines to index your content better and present it more prominently in search results.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will Molongui Authorship work with my theme? =

Yes. Molongui Authorship will work with any theme, but may require [premium styling features](https://www.molongui.com/product/authorship) to make it match nicely.

= Where is the author box displayed? =

The author box is displayed there where you want it to be displayed. You can configure to show it on all posts and pages or just on those you select. Also, you can choose whether to display it above or below the content.

You can also automatically show the author box on any custom post-type or add as many author boxes as you wish anywhere with the Premium version of the plugin, which is available [here](https://www.molongui.com/product/authorship "Molongui Authorship Premium").

= Why should I give credit to authors who write in my blog? =

Whatever your reason for having a blog, whether it's for business or a personal hobby, it's important to do it right. In order to boost SEO rankings, gain traffic and leads, you need to have great content on your blog. And when it comes to creating great content, it really does matter who is writing. Authorship provides significant benefits:

* Higher click through rates
* Higher visibility
* Higher page views
* Lower plagiarism
* Build trust
* Elevate the role of the writer
* Establish authority

[Molongui Authorship plugin](https://www.molongui.com/product/authorship "Molongui Authorship plugin") allows you to give credit to any author who writes in your blog, whether it has a registered user on your WordPress installation or not (guest author). Check the plugin features above.

= What if the post is written by a guest author? =

A custom post-type is defined so guest authors can be chosen as post authors without having a registered account on your WordPress site. Use "Guest authors" from the WP admin menu and add a new guest author.

= Why would I care about guest posting? =

Whether you are a re-known author or not, guest posting is a good strategy for growing your blog readership and platform. "Guest posting" means writing and publishing an article on someone else's website or blog. If you allow people guest-posting on your site, you need a way to give them credit for their content so it can be a win-win situation for both (you and your guest authors). Authorship is important to the reputation, professional advancement and financial support of bloggers.

= Why Linkedin and Xing profiles are premium options? =

Both social networks are intended for business and professional networking and we require you to purchase the premium plugin for commercial use.

= Where are all the social networks the plugin features? I can't see them all... =

To avoid clutter the edit page, some social networks are not displayed by default. To configure which networks to display, go to the plugin settings page.

= Where can I find documentation and user guides? =

For help setting up and configuring this plugin, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.molongui.com/docs/).

= How do I get support for this plugin? =

We're following the threads and based on them we always try to build up new and better implementations for the plugin. If you want Premium Support, that also comes with High Priority, then go to [our support page](https://www.molongui.com/product/authorship/ "Molongui Support").
